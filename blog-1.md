Blog 1: The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.


TypeScriptâ€™s powerful type system includes features like union types and intersection types that help developers write safer and more maintainable code. 

Union Types:

Union types are a way to specify that a variable can be one of several types. They are defined using the |

    * A union type allows a variable to hold one of several types.

    * You can only access properties and methods that exist on all the types in the union.

    * At runtime, you can use conditional checks (such as typeof or instanceof) to determine the specific type the variable holds.


Example: 

    type a = string;
    type b = number;
    type c = a | b; // union type


Intersection type:

Combine multiple types into one, denoted by the "&".

    * An intersection type combines the structure of two or more types into a single type.

    * Intersection types are commonly used to define objects that need to implement multiple interfaces or extend multiple classes.
    *  Intersection types can also be combined with union types to represent complex data structures that may contain values from multiple sources with differing types

Example:

    interface User1 {
        id: number;
        name: string;
    }
    interface User2{
        role: string;
    }
    
    // apply intersection
    let userAdmin : User1 & User2 ={
        id: 1,
        name : "sajedul", 
        role: "admin"
    }
